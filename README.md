-Generally used for informal or temporary tagging.
-Creation ----->> git tag v1.7

**Annotated
-Richer Information: Includes metadata like author name, email, date, and a descriptive message.
-Stored as a separate object in the Git database.
-Typically used for official releases, detailed tags, or documentation.
-Creation ----->> git tag -a v1.7 -m "version 1.7"

** git tag

//To delete tags locally:

//To delete tags remotely:
** git push origin --d v1.7

// When to use Rebase
-When i want to clean up the commit history before sharing it with others.
-When i want to Synchronize my feature brances with the main branch.
-If i want to rewrite history if the branch has not yet pushed.
-When i want to avoid merge commits.
